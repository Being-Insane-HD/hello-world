# hello-world
just a beginning

Hi, everyone!
Hrishikesh Deka here.
You can simply call me Jack or HD, if you want to.
I am just a simple C++ nerd, trying to create and share new and if possible, some innovative and helpful C++ programs.
Hope you like them.
And please do correct me, if there is any mistake. And constructive feedback is welcomed.
Looking forward to working with you all in future.
Hope we will be able to change the world together for a brighter future, DIGITALLY!!!  ヾ(⌐■_■)ノ♪
Thanks for reading and helping.

Take care and good luck everyone!!!
